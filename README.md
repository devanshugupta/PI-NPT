## Overview

Hi, good to see you here! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out the code for Non-Parametric Transformers (NPTs).

This codebase will allow you to reproduce experiments from the paper as well as use NPTs for your own research.

## Abstract

We challenge a common assumption underlying most supervised deep learning: that a model makes a prediction depending only on its parameters and the features of a single input. To this end, we introduce a general-purpose deep learning architecture that takes as input the entire dataset instead of processing one datapoint at a time. Our approach uses self-attention to reason about relationships between datapoints explicitly, which can be seen as realizing non-parametric models using parametric attention mechanisms. However, unlike conventional non-parametric models, we let the model learn end-to-end from the data how to make use of other datapoints for prediction. Empirically, our models solve cross-datapoint lookup and complex reasoning tasks unsolvable by traditional deep learning models. We show highly competitive results on tabular data, early results on CIFAR-10, and give insight into how the model makes use of the interactions between points.

## Installation

Set up and activate the Python environment by executing

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate npt
```

For now, we recommend installing CUDA <= 10.2:

See [issue with CUDA >= 11.0 here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/47908).
 
If you are running this on a system without a GPU, use the above with `environment_no_gpu.yml` instead.

## Examples

We now give some basic examples of running NPT.

NPT downloads all supported datasets automatically, so you don't need to worry about that.

We use [wandb](http://wandb.com/) to log experimental results.
Wandb allows us to conveniently track run progress online.
If you do not want wandb enabled, you can run `wandb off` in the shell where you execute NPT.

For example, run this to explore NPT with default configuration on ODE dataset

```
python run.py --data_set ode
```

You can find all possible config arguments and descriptions in `NPT/configs.py` or using `python run.py --help`.

In `scripts/` we provide a list with the runs and correct hyperparameter configurations presented in the paper.

We hope you enjoy using the code and please feel free to reach out with any questions ðŸ˜Š
